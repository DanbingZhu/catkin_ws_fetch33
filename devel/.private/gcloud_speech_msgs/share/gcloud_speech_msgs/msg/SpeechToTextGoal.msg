# Equivalent to google.cloud.speech.v1.StreamingRecognitionConfig. See also:

# A list of strings containing words and phrases "hints" so that the speech
# recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to improve the
# accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are
# typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add additional words to
# the vocabulary of the recognizer.
string[] hints

# Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Specifically, the
# maximum number of RecognitionHypothesis messages within each
# SpeechToTextFeedback. The server may return fewer than max_alternatives. Valid
# values are 0-30. A value of 0 or 1 will return a maximum of one. If omitted,
# will return a maximum of one.
int32 max_alternatives

# Maximum listening duration. The recognizer will start listening immediately,
# and will stop listening after "listen_duration_sec" seconds. If 0 or omitted,
# will use an internal default value (14 seconds).
int32 listen_duration_sec

# Maximum recognition duration. The recognizer will start counting down
# immediately, and after max_recognition_duration_sec seconds it will return no
# matter whether there is a recognition result. If 0 or omitted, will use
# a default value: listen_duration_sec + 2.
int32 max_recognition_duration_sec


# If false or omitted, interim results (tentative hypotheses) may be returned as
# they become available (these interim results are indicated with the
# is_portion_final=false flag). If true, only is_portion_final=true result(s)
# are returned.
